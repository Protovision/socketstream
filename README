socketstream is a minimal and lightweight header-only library. It is 
cross platform between UNIX and Windows.

socketstream allows you to create an std::iostream-derived object from an
existing native socket handle. That's about it.

Include socketstream.hh to start using. Documentation is embedded in the 
hh files.

net_utility.hh includes a function make_connected_socket for creating 
and connecting a native socket handle. 

See example.cc for an example that makes a simple HTTP request.
