socketstream is a header-only library for socket I/O.

The following classes are defined:

	swoope::socketbuf:
		An std::streambuf derived class that implements a raw socket
		device.

	swoope::socketstream: 
		An std::iostream derived class that implements high-level 
		stream input/output on a swoope::socketbuf.

socketstream works with POSIX and Windows.

See example.cc for an example that makes a simple HTTP request.
